# CPU scheduling and how Round Robin work

# Project implementation and how to analyze the program output.

# the resulting output of your program using five different time quantum on the same process list

## The analysis of the results of the five runtimes 
### exhibit the performance of the algorithm based on 
#### the size of the time quantum how this size impacts the outcome of the scheduling
