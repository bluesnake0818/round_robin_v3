# CPU scheduling and how Round Robin work
- CPU scheduling is the process by which multiple processes share a single processor in order to maximize the utilization of the processor and minimize the time needed for each process to complete its task. 

- Round Robin is a scheduling algorithm that assigns a fixed time slice to each process in a queue in a cyclic manner. Each process is assigned a time slice in order, and once a process has used its allotted time, it is preempted and the next process is scheduled. This process is repeated until all processes have been executed.

# Project implementation and how to analyze the program output.

# Bug
- the processes don't show the first time a file is uploaded. Upload file, and then input time quantum. Then, the data table updates completely. 

# the resulting output of your program using five different time quantum on the same process list
